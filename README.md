Data Cleaning
There is a file containing weather data for three stations in the weather csv file on Moodle. Read it into Python as a Pandas DataFrame. 
(a) List all problems you can find with the dataset that could be improved before analysing it. 
(b) Use Python to make the dataset as suitable as possible for analysis ie. solve the problems you have identified. Make sure the dataset is being updated with the changes you make. 
(c) Remove the mean hourly wind speed column. It is not needed for analysis. 
(d) Save the cleaned dataset as a new csv file called weather_edit.csv for later analysis.

Indexing, Slicing and Filtering
Having tidied the data and made it more suitable for analysis, answer the following questions. The questions should be answered using Python code to output the answer to the console, not by visual inspection. 
(a) What was the hourly rainfall value at station number 215 at 11:00 on 30/06/2010? 
(b) When was the highest mean hourly humidity value at station number 215 recorded? (c) How many hourly minimum temperature values at station number 621 are less than 20°C? 
(d) Find the daily maximum temperature at station number 542 on 07/01/2012. 
(e) Find the sum of the non-missing hourly rainfall values at station number 621 in May 2012. 
(f) Sort the dataset by hourly maximum temperature in descending order, then by minimum temperature in ascending order. 
(g) Output the values of hourly maximum temperature when the mean hourly humidity is between 60 and 65. 
(h) Find all rows in the dataset in which hourly rainfall exceeded 58mm or the hourly maximum temperature was at most 20°C. 
(i) Output all rows that do not have any missing values. 
(j) Which station number had the highest number of hourly minimum temperatures equal to 21.5°C?
